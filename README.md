Welcome to my Capture The Flag (CTF) writeup repository. Each event has its own set of markdown files. If this grows large enough, we will set up a Docusaurus instance to hold them.

## Virtual Machines
`virt-manager` for VMs. These run well and are easy to manage on Linux. You can utilize the Virtual Machine Manager GUI to create and manage KVMs.

```
pacman -Syu virt-manager
```

## Notes
[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) synced to OneDrive for note taking in markdown. I can then easily transfer the files to GitHub.
